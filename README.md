Network Intrusion Detection systems - 
Task to build network intrusion detection system to detect anamolies and attacks in the network. There are two problems. 1. Binomial Classification: Activity is normal or attack 2. Multinomial classification: Activity is normal or DOS or PROBE or R2L or U2R.
Data-set used is KDDCUPâ€™99 data set, which is widely used as one of the few publicly available data sets for network-based anomaly detection systems.
